# 14 AAG Mission Template

***This repository holds all the logic we require to run our missions, everything from custom Zeus modules & compositions to the respawn system and whitelist.***

## Loading the template

Before you do anything, load into the arma editor and load the map you want to create a mission on. save this as a new mission. 

- Go to where this mission was saved. In most cases it will be saved here:

```
C:\Users\%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\SGT%20B%2e%20Wayne\missions\mission_name.map_name
```

- Download this repo and copy the contents into your own mission save folder.

Your mission will now have all the required scripts and modules that a 14AAG mission needs.

Check the wiki tab for more detail on different aspects of the mission template
